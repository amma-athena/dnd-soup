# dnd-soup

There's this podcast I really enjoy listening to, called [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/). In it, Jack Rhysider tells "stories from the dark side of the internet".
Usually, these episodes contain interviews with people who did things on the internet. I noticed how the interviewed subjects often share their motives, their thoughts/feelings leading up to certain acts.
And I wondered: 

Can we learn something from those statements?

# the project

Here's a project in which I:

<br>a) learn how to do webscraping and 
<br>b) use beautiful soup to
<br>c) analyze texts from one of my favorite podcasts.

Once I get a better understanding of how this is useful for you, I'll update the readme :-)
The project file structure has a python-y datafiles/scripts/venv structure, but that may change in the future OR I'll update this file to let you know how to use it. Not sure what the best setup for that is yet.

## Deck of Useful Items

### How to use your venv
1. Make sure you meet the [requirements].
2. activate your venv (in my case it's):

``` source venv/bin/activate ```

Make sure you meet the requirements.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

When you wrap up your project for the day, make sure to save your requirements.

``` pip freeze > requirements.txt``` 

And finally, deactivate the virtual environment.

```deactivate ```

Sounds easy. Sucks when you forget to.

Might remove this and just refer to other (better) documentation at some point.
There's _many_ different ways to do this, depending on your OS/version of python/phase of the moon or whatever.
