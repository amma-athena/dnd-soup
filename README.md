# dnd-soup

There's this podcast I really enjoy listening to, called [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/). In it, Jack Rhysider tells "stories from the dark side of the internet".
Usually, these episodes contain interviews with people who did things on the internet. I noticed how the interviewed subjects often share their motives, their thoughts/feelings leading up to certain acts.
And I wondered: 

Can we learn something from those statements?

# the project

Here's a project in which I:

<br>a) learn how to do webscraping and 
<br>b) use beautiful soup to
<br>c) analyze texts from one of my favorite podcasts.

Once I get a better understanding of how this is useful for you, I'll update the readme :-)
